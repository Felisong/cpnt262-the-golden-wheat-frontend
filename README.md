## Introduction

This is a group project made by Rufaro, Mark, Gaberiel, Ethan and Carolina. We are a team of students working to create a fully functional website. We all attend SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology). In this project we will be showcasing our knowledge of React, NextJS, and Tailwind.

In our backend Rufaro, and Gabriel were our back end specialists. They worked with MongoDB, and got our database schemas set up and linked.

Ethan, Mark and myself (Carolina), we in charge of the front end.

## instructions for the Team

Hi everyone, please note you each have your own branches in all lowercase. Please work on your branches when working and in your own pages. Reach out to me if there are any complications.

```
git checkout gabriel
```

in example.

You will find your own pages inside the app folder. Please feel free to add more if you find that we need another page. Please clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/Felisong/cpnt262-the-golden-wheat-frontend
```

Once in, open your terminal and type in:

```
npm run dev
```

to start the server.

Click on the link that appears in the terminal. If you want the website to be fully functional locally, download the back end repository and follow instructions (enter "node app.js" into the terminal) and make sure their server is running as well.

If not things will fail to fetch on the front end, and will not look as intended.
